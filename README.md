# Java-Snake-Game
Java Snake Game,
This is a really basic code fundamental game I found online and added a few changes to it,
The original creator u/janbodnar did not want the game to exceed any limits as it was a beginner friendly source code project,
so with that being said... the goal of this repo is to add things but also keep it beginner friendly...

How to keep it beginner friendly?
Comments! Do not overcomment please unless its a really complex thing for a beginner such as for loops.
If you end up adding a new file please explain at the top what the file is for and a little documentation on it. An example would be creating a new Java Class called Settings, inside the class file I suggest writing a little bit about the class and what it does and how beginners (who are looking to mod the game and create custom modes) how they can achieve it, an example would be

```
/*
Settings:
  
  addSetting(String name, Boolean toggle)
    - Adds a setting to the settings menu with the toggle button.
  addSetting(String name, int value)
    - Adds a setting to the settings menu with an int value (23.3)
*/
```

Also P.S I am completely new to java and just decided to yolo this repo, enjoy and be great fellas!

## Future Plans:

- Menu
- Score Tracker (High Score As Well)
- Help
- Settings
- Custom Modes (More Apples, Speed Changes)
- Demolish any bugs.
- Better Icons Lol
