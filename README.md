# Java-Snake-Game
Java Snake Game,
This is a really basic code fundamental game I found online and added a few changes to it,
This repo is used for beginners wondering how complex / technical coding methods work, or for those who want to play snake at work :), and AI machine learning, and especially those who want to contribute!
The goal of this repo is to add things but also keep it beginner friendly...

How to keep it beginner friendly?
Comments! Do not overcomment please unless its a really complex thing for a beginner such as for loops.
If you end up adding a new file please explain at the top what the file is for and a little documentation on it. An example would be creating a new Java Class called Settings, inside the class file I suggest writing something like this and what it does and how beginners (who are curious or whatever) can use it, an example would be

```
/*
Settings:
  
  addSetting(String name, Boolean toggle)
    - Adds a setting to the settings menu with the toggle button.
  addSetting(String name, int value)
    - Adds a setting to the settings menu with an int value (23)
*/
```

Also P.S I am completely new to java and just decided to yolo this repo P.S i never used github before, enjoy and be great fellas!

## Future Plans:

- Menu
- Help
- Settings
- Demolish any bugs.
